# About the Agentic Trust Framework

ATF is a **specification and reference architecture** for implementing Zero Trust security for AI agents.

## Current Status

- **Specification**: Open for discussion and feedback
- **Implementation**: Being developed for ZeroTrustAgents.ai
- **Contributions**: Currently limited to specification discussions

## How to Participate

### Specification Feedback
- Open issues for specification clarifications
- Suggest improvements via discussions
- Share your implementation experiences

### Build Your Own Implementation
- ATF is Apache 2.0 licensed
- Build your own implementation following the spec
- Share your learnings with the community

### Future Collaboration
As the specification matures and ZeroTrustAgents.ai demonstrates the framework in production, we may open up for code contributions with proper technical review processes in place.

## What This Is NOT

- Not accepting code PRs currently
- Not a community-driven implementation
- Not conducting regular calls or meetings

## Why This Approach?

Security is critical. We're building the reference implementation ourselves for use in our production platforms (YourFirstAgent.ai and ZeroTrustAgents.ai) to ensure the highest security standards.
