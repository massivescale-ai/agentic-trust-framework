# Agentic Trust Framework Specification

**Version**: 0.1.0-draft  
**Status**: Draft  
**Last Updated**: Aug 9, 2025

## Abstract

This document specifies the Agentic Trust Framework (ATF), a security framework for AI agents based on Zero Trust principles. ATF defines requirements for identity management, behavioral monitoring, data governance, segmentation, and incident response in AI agent systems.

## 1. Introduction

AI agents with access to enterprise systems require security boundaries. This specification defines a framework for implementing Zero Trust security principles in AI agent deployments.

The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC 2119](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2119.txt).

## 2. Terminology

**Agent**: An autonomous AI system capable of perceiving its environment and taking actions to achieve specific goals.

**Agent Identity**: A unique, cryptographically verifiable identifier assigned to each agent instance.

**Behavioral Baseline**: The established pattern of normal operations for a specific agent.

**Data Governance**: The process of validating inputs and filtering outputs of an agent.

**Segmentation**: Access control mechanisms that limit agent permissions based on the principle of least privilege.

**Kill Switch**: A mechanism to immediately halt agent operations.

## 3. Conformance Requirements

An implementation is considered ATF-compliant if it:

1. Implements all five core elements defined in Section 4
2. Passes the ATF compliance test suite
3. Follows the security considerations in Section 5

Implementations MAY extend ATF with additional features but MUST NOT violate core requirements.

## 4. Core Elements

### 4.1 Identity Management

**Requirement**: Every agent MUST have a unique, verifiable identity.

#### 4.1.1 Identity Creation

Implementations MUST:
- Generate cryptographically unique identifiers for each agent instance
- Bind identities to specific agent versions and configurations
- Support identity rotation without service disruption

Implementations SHOULD:
- Use industry-standard identity formats (UUID, JWT, x.509)
- Support federated identity providers
- Log all identity lifecycle events

#### 4.1.2 Identity Verification

Each agent request MUST include:
- Agent identifier
- Timestamp
- Cryptographic proof of identity (signature, token, or certificate)

Example interface (non-normative):
```python
class IdentityManager(Protocol):
    def create_identity(self, agent_config: Dict) -> AgentIdentity:
        """Create new agent identity"""
        
    def verify_identity(self, credentials: Credentials) -> bool:
        """Verify agent credentials"""
        
    def rotate_identity(self, old_id: AgentIdentity) -> AgentIdentity:
        """Rotate credentials maintaining continuity"""
```

### 4.2 Behavioral Monitoring

**Requirement**: Agent behavior MUST be continuously monitored for anomalies.

#### 4.2.1 Baseline Establishment

Implementations MUST:
- Collect behavioral metrics for at least 7 days or 1000 operations
- Define normal ranges for key metrics (latency, token usage, API calls)
- Update baselines periodically (at least monthly)

Metrics to monitor MUST include:
- Request frequency and patterns
- Resource consumption (tokens, API calls, compute)
- Input/output characteristics
- Error rates and types

#### 4.2.2 Anomaly Detection

Implementations MUST:
- Detect deviations from baseline exceeding configured thresholds
- Generate alerts within 60 seconds of anomaly detection
- Support both statistical and rule-based detection

Implementations SHOULD:
- Use ML-based anomaly detection where appropriate
- Correlate anomalies across multiple agents
- Provide anomaly severity scoring

### 4.3 Data Governance

**Requirement**: All agent inputs and outputs MUST be validated.

#### 4.3.1 Input Validation

Implementations MUST:
- Validate data schema and types
- Detect potential injection attacks
- Check for data poisoning patterns

Validation types REQUIRED:
- Schema validation
- Content filtering for malicious patterns
- Statistical anomaly detection for data drift

#### 4.3.2 Output Filtering

Implementations MUST:
- Scan outputs for sensitive data (PII, secrets, credentials)
- Apply configurable content filtering
- Log all filtering actions

Implementations SHOULD:
- Support custom filtering rules
- Provide redaction capabilities
- Enable output sampling for audit

### 4.4 Segmentation

**Requirement**: Agent access MUST be limited by least-privilege policies.

#### 4.4.1 Access Control

Implementations MUST:
- Define granular permissions per agent
- Support time-based access restrictions
- Enable dynamic permission adjustment based on context

Policy elements REQUIRED:
- Resource access lists (APIs, databases, services)
- Operation permissions (read, write, execute)
- Rate limits and quotas

#### 4.4.2 Network Isolation

Implementations SHOULD:
- Support network-level segmentation
- Enable API gateway integration
- Provide service mesh compatibility

### 4.5 Incident Response

**Requirement**: Systems MUST support rapid agent containment and recovery.

#### 4.5.1 Kill Switch

Implementations MUST:
- Provide immediate agent termination capability (<1 second)
- Support graceful and forced shutdown modes
- Maintain audit log of all kill switch activations

#### 4.5.2 Recovery

Implementations MUST:
- Support rollback to last known good configuration
- Provide incident investigation capabilities
- Enable selective agent restart with restrictions

Implementations SHOULD:
- Automate common incident response procedures
- Integrate with enterprise incident management
- Support forensic data collection

## 5. Security Considerations

### 5.1 Cryptographic Requirements

All cryptographic operations SHOULD use:
- AES-256 for symmetric encryption
- RSA-2048 or ECC P-256 for asymmetric operations
- SHA-256 or stronger for hashing

### 5.2 Key Management

Implementations MUST:
- Never store keys in plain text
- Support key rotation
- Use hardware security modules where available

### 5.3 Audit Logging

All security-relevant events MUST be logged including:
- Identity operations
- Policy changes
- Anomaly detections
- Kill switch activations
