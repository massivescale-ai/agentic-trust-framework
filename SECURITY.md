# Security Principles for ATF Implementation

This document outlines core security principles that all ATF implementations should follow.

## Core Security Principles

### 1. Defense in Depth
No single security control should be relied upon. Implement multiple layers:
- Network security (segmentation)
- Application security (input validation)
- Data security (encryption)
- Operational security (monitoring)

### 2. Least Privilege
Every agent should have the minimum permissions required:
- Start with zero permissions
- Add only what's necessary
- Time-bound access when possible
- Regular permission audits

### 3. Zero Trust Verification
Never trust, always verify:
- Verify every request
- Assume breach mindset
- Continuous validation
- No implicit trust zones

### 4. Fail Secure
When something goes wrong, fail safely:
- Deny by default
- Graceful degradation
- Automatic containment
- Preserve audit trails

## Implementation Guidelines

### Cryptographic Standards
- Use established algorithms (AES-256, RSA-2048 minimum)
- Never roll your own crypto
- Secure random number generation
- Regular key rotation

### Secrets Management
- Never hardcode credentials
- Use secure key storage (HSM when possible)
- Implement secret rotation
- Audit secret access

### Logging and Monitoring
- Log all security events
- Protect logs from tampering
- Retain logs per compliance requirements
- Alert on anomalies

### Incident Response
- Pre-defined response procedures
- Clear escalation paths
- Regular drills
- Post-incident reviews

## Security Considerations by Element

### Identity Management
- Cryptographically strong identities
- Regular credential rotation
- Multi-factor authentication where possible
- Identity lifecycle management

### Behavioral Monitoring
- Baseline before monitoring
- Statistical and rule-based detection
- Low false positive rates
- Automated response capabilities

### Data Governance
- Input validation is mandatory
- Output filtering for compliance
- Data classification
- Encryption at rest and in transit

### Segmentation
- Network isolation
- API rate limiting
- Resource quotas
- Time-based restrictions

### Incident Response
- Sub-second kill switch
- State preservation for forensics
- Automated containment
- Recovery procedures

## Compliance Considerations

While ATF doesn't mandate specific compliance frameworks, consider:
- EU AI Act for AI regulation
- ISO 42001 for AI management systems
- GDPR for data protection
- HIPAA for healthcare data
- PCI DSS for payment data
- SOC 2 for service providers

## Threat Model

ATF implementations should protect against:
- Prompt injection attacks
- Data poisoning
- Model theft
- Denial of service
- Lateral movement
- Data exfiltration

## Security Reviews

All ATF implementations should undergo:
- Code security review
- Penetration testing
- Compliance audit
- Regular vulnerability assessments

## Responsible Disclosure

If you discover a security vulnerability in an ATF implementation:
1. Do not publicly disclose without coordination
2. Contact the implementation maintainer
3. Allow reasonable time for fixes
4. Coordinate disclosure timing
